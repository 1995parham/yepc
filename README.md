## Introduction

Another compiler project, nothing else. every year students of
Amirkabir University of Technology write a simple compiler and
nothing change, we are just two of them.

## How To Run

We have planty of time, so we have created the an Angular Frontend for our project.
The frontend project is outdated but with the help from [here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/55921442/how-to-fix-referenceerror-primordials-is-not-defined-in-node),
it works now.

```sh
